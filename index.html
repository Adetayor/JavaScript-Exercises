    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals – Part 1</h1>
    <p>
      Numbers, Letters, Underscore_ and dollar sign$ are used to
      name variable in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript programmes are executed from top to bottom, in strings
      the quotes must be the same, single in the beginning and end, or double quotes
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time you declare a variable use the word let, but don't use let the 
      secondtime in changing what you first declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use let for variable we can mutate or change?
      we use const for variable we cant mutate and change. we cant declare empty
      const message.
      Change variable introduce bugs into the code.
      var is the old way to declare variable just like let. var should be avoided,
      let is block scoped and var is function scoped. Always declare variables Properly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An operator allows us to transform and combine multiple values, mathematical(arithemetric), 
      comparison, logical, assignment operators are all types of operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Template Literals (` `)is used to manage complex or multiple strings. template literals assemble
       multiple pieces of strings into one final string (Template strings). We can use backtakes for regular strings
       we don't need to worry about the quotations. 
       \n\ means New Line should be created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type Conversion is we convert data types manually, from one type to the other 
      while type Coercion is when javaScript automatically does the conversion for us and its hidden from us.
